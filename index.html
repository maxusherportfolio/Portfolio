                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Max Usher, I'm an aspiring mechanical engineer who loves to take things apart and learn how they work. I recieved my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Florida, where I gained valuable experience working with the Formula SAE program.</p>
                <h2> </h2>
                <p>I am dedicated to hands-on learning and design oriented projects. My experiences include purchasing a 35-year-old car to gain firsthand knowledge of how cars work, teaching myself to code in python and MATLAB to enhance my contributions during my internship, experimenting with carbon fiber production, and I taught myself how to make websites just like this one!</p>
                <h2> </h2>
                <p>I have also learned to machine parts using both mills and lathes and helped the lab technician machine a wide variety of parts, even getting to write g-code for a CNC!</p>
                <h2></h2>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Currently, it highlights my personal and academic projects, as I am unable to share the majority of details from my internship due to NDA's. I hope these projects provide a deeper insight into my skills and experience. If you would like to learn more about all of the projects that I worked on at Roush and FSAE, please feel free to contact me to set up a call!</p>

                    <p>01/2023-05/2023</p>
                    <p>During my time as an Advanced Engineering Intern at Roush I worked on a multitude of exciting and challenging projects. The Advanced engineering group worked on contracts from other companies and the work I did ranged from working on FEA on the back seats of the Leidos/NASCAR moon rover, to designing and selecting components for a class 8 truck test rig that had a propellor system mounted to the front of it, to reverse engineering a gyroscope to make boats more stable. My proudest moment working there was making very early estimates for what weight would be on the front axle of the class 8 test rig after everything was put on and only being off a few percent of the reality which saved lots of headache and allowed the team to properly prepare!</p>

                    <p>08/2021-12/2022</p>
                    <p>During my first year with Gator motorsports I worked in the brakes team and got to work on rerouting the brake lines, work with the drivers to set a predictable brake lock up point, and construct a brake rotor test stand using a donated electric motor. During my second year I switched to the suspension team to learn more about the process of designing the entire system and got to do lots of kinematic analysis for the transition over to an electric motor.</p>
