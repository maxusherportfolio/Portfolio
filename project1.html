                <h2> </h2>
                <p>Almost 5 year ago I bought this lemon with the sole purpose of learning how to work on cars with my goal of trying to everything that I can myself.</p>
                <h2> </h2>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>Over time, I've worked extensively on my E30, starting with a complete overhaul of the brake system. I replaced the brake pads, rotors, and brake lines, and swapped out the passenger-side front caliper. The remaining calipers were refurbished by cleaning and removing rust, followed by repainting to ensure longevity. I also upgraded the brake booster and master cylinder to improve braking performance. In the cooling system, I replaced the fan and fan clutch, cleaned out the radiator and hoses, and installed a new electric fan to aid cooling efficiency. The thermostat was replaced, and I cleaned out the water pump to ensure smooth operation.</p>
                <p>In terms of the electrical system, I rewired the engine harness due to corroded rubber wiring and cleaned up the mess left by the previous owner under the dashboard, where twist ties had been used. I also upgraded the audio system by replacing the speakers and head unit, added new gauges, and resoldered parts of the dashboard to fix electrical issues. For the suspension, I installed new shocks, race springs, and polyurethane bushings, while refurbishing hardware by removing rust and repainting. On the bodywork front, I tackled rust on the roof, filled in the holes with bondo, and repainted it to restore the car's appearance.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I replaced the clutch, pivot point, and the master and slave cylinders for smoother shifting. I resealed both the engine and transmission using new gaskets and O-rings, adjusted the valve timing, and swapped out the timing belt. The fuel system was revamped with new fuel lines, a filter, injectors, pumps, and a pressure regulator, while the cold start injector was thoroughly cleaned. To finish off, I added some personal touches, including tinting the windows, restoring the exterior paint through polishing, and installing bucket seats to enhance the driving experience.</p>
