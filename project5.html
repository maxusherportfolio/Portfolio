                <h2>Background</h2>
                <h2> </h2>
                <p>This project's objective was to create a highly functional and versatile wheelchair design intended for everyday use. This study set out to solve the problems that many wheelchair users report experiencing: Back discomfort from less-than-ideal back support, lack of weather protection, and frustration with a standard push rim driving mechanism. This project seeks to develop a new concept for the wheelchair that allows for reclining when stationary, a driving system with improved mechanical advantage, protection from weather when out and about, and improved aesthetics where the device does not appear “ugly” or “medical” looking.  </p>
                <p>The bulk of the project revolved aroung the discover phase, creating a need statement and finding target market, the define phase, designating design requirements and product modeling, the develop phase, creating combination charts and designs, and the deliver phase, creating the final design and the analysis of the design.</p>
                <h2> </h2>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The design strategy implemented for the Air Cruiser prioritized ease of use and multi-functionality, with the limited mobility of the user in mind. Through market research. interviews with current wheelchair users, and project design requirements, the following wheelchair features were identified and prioritized: weather protection, seat reclination, a driving system more mechanically advantageous than a standard push rim, and an attractive look that does not appear medical looking. Multiple subsystems were designed to satisfy these criteria and were combined to allow the user to easily operate the device. </p>
                <p>The members of Trek Engineered were divided into smaller sub-teams to focus on each sub-system more efficiently. The sub-systems designed consisted of the following: Frame, Propulsion and Braking, Seat and Storage, and Weather Protection. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>The wheelchair frame provides the chair's foundation and mounting locations for all other subsystems. The frame is made of hollow aluminum tubing, ensuring that it limits weight where possible, while still supporting the weight of the chair and user. </p>
                <p>The weather protection subsystem allows the user to comfortably operate in various weather conditions. This sub-system consists of a hand actuated crank and worm gear that deploys an umbrella via an internal threaded rod. As the user turns the first handle, the umbrella shaft rises into position. As the user turns the second handle the umbrella canopy opens, allowing the user to deploy the system easily from their seat.  </p>
                <p>The propulsion and braking sub-system uses a ratcheting mechanism to allow the user to propel the wheelchair either forwards or backwards, depending on the handle position. The user can twist the handle to change which direction the lever will engage with the wheel, allowing the user to easily position the lever in their desired position for propulsion. The braking system employed on the Air Cruiser is a mechanical disc brake system, with all components being outsourced from an established manufacturer. Each wheel will have its own independent braking system.  </p>
                <p>The seat and storage subsystem of the wheelchair serves as the chair for the user to sit on while providing lumbar support and comfort. This system carries most of the direct weight, so it is built sturdy enough to keep the user in place as they ride the wheelchair around. The seat also holds the two storages connected to the armrests and one below the seat which are meant to keep the user’s belongings secure with utmost proximity and convenience.  </p>
