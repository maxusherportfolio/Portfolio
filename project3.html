                <h2>Background</h2>
                <h2> </h2>
                <p>The goal of the LapDog™ project was to build and test an apparatus to assist veterinarians with canine laparoscopic procedures. This apparatus was to be used alongside the patented Lift Loop™ device, which enables abdominal wall lifting- a safer and cheaper alternative to the more traditional abdominal insufflation. No commercial product existed that could facilitate this type of surgery. Key customer needs include the ability to articulate the apparatus in all three dimensions, to support up to fifty pounds, to rigidly attach to surgical operating tables, and to be fit for use in a medical setting. After three months of brainstorming, designing, prototyping, and manufacturing, LapDog™ is proud to announce the successful performance of its novel apparatus- named the DogHouse™- during a demonstration on a cadaver canine at the University of Florida (UF) Small Animal Hospital. The DogHouse™ can be attached to a variety of tables, with motion in both horizontal directions actuated by disposable (sterile) knobs, at a rate of 0.5 inches of linear travel per rotation. Motion in the vertical direction is actuated by two 3D-printed hand winches, which are self-locking and can be independently operated at a rate of 0.44 inches per handle rotation. The DogHouse™ has proven successful at bearing 50 pounds, which enables operations on animals up to 300 pounds. The LapDog™ project was a great success, meeting all the customer needs as shown by the live demonstration. The team is undergoing further action to promote widespread use of the DogHouse™ in veterinary clinics across the state of Florida.  </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The process for this project began with a clear set of goals that the team needed to achieve by the project's end. Each team member was responsible for developing their own preliminary design, after which we collaboratively evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal. We prioritized key design elements by weighing them against the project&apos;s goals and criteria, and ultimately, we selected the best components through a team voting process. Once the core design elements were chosen, we entered the iterative phase, where the team refined and integrated all the components into a cohesive initial design.</p>
                <p>With the initial design established, the next step involved conducting rigorous Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and applying fundamental engineering principles to evaluate the viability of each component. If a part failed to meet our predetermined safety factors or was found to be overly complex, we would redesign and test it again, continually refining the model until all aspects of the system met our performance standards. This phase required careful attention to detail, as each modification had to balance functionality, safety, and efficiency.</p>
                <p>Once the design passed all analytical evaluations, we proceeded to the manufacturing and assembly phase. Parts were ordered, and we began constructing the first prototype. The prototype underwent extensive testing, particularly in worst-case scenarios, to ensure that it met and exceeded the project's initial performance goals. During testing, we identified areas for minor improvements, which were quickly addressed to optimize the system. Once finalized, the prototype was presented for cadaver testing at the veterinary hospital, where it successfully performed beyond expectations, marking the project as a resounding success.</p>
                <p>My primary contributions to the project were in the design of the winch mechanism and the detailed FEA of the frame. The winch system was a critical component of the project, and I took responsibility for designing a custom 3D-printed winch that would provide a lightweight, quiet, and efficient solution for raising and lowering the abdominal wall. Achieving the right balance between spool size and spool speed per turn required eight iterations of the design. Eventually, I engineered a custom worm gear and housing that not only met but exceeded the project&apos;s operational goals, delivering smooth and consistent performance.</p>
                <p>In addition to the winch system, I played a key role in the structural analysis of the frame, which was constructed from 80/20 extruded aluminum. The frame needed to maintain precise tolerances, as it incorporated nylon linear bearing pads that allowed various subsystems to slide and function together. Using FEA and mechanics of materials, I calculated the allowable bending, torsion, and load-bearing capacity of the frame. This analysis was crucial to ensure the integrity of the design, and it enabled me to recommend modifications that ultimately improved the frame&apos;s overall functionality. By ensuring that the frame could withstand the expected forces while maintaining alignment, I helped guarantee that the final product operated seamlessly during testing.</p>
                <p>In summary, this project provided invaluable hands-on experience in collaborative design, engineering analysis, and practical problem-solving. From initial concept to final testing, I contributed both to the strategic planning and technical execution, ensuring that the team&apos;s vision was successfully realized.</p>
