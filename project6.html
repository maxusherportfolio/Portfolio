                <h2>Background</h2>
                <h2> </h2>
                <p>The object of this lab was to characterize the fan systems and create data to be used for sizing a fan for a fan/pipe system. We had to determine the fan ead rise, fan efficiency at various rpms over the full range of flow rates for each rpm, and the annual costs for running the pumps.</p>
                <h2> </h2>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>To conduct this lab, we utilized a sophisticated experimental setup designed to characterize the performance of centrifugal fan systems equipped with both backward and radial impellers. The apparatus included key components such as a 75 mm inlet nozzle, an impeller driven by a universal dynamometer, an adjustable slide valve for controlling airflow resistance, and digital pressure sensors positioned at strategic points, including the nozzle inlet, before and after the centrifugal fan, and at ambient pressure. These sensors enabled us to capture critical pressure changes across the system as we varied the operating conditions.</p>
                <p>The experiment involved running the fans at five different speeds, ranging from 1000 to 3000 RPM, while adjusting the airflow resistance from fully open to fully closed using the slide valve. During each test, we allowed the system to stabilize before recording data to ensure consistent and accurate measurements. The computer system continuously captured a range of performance metrics, including volumetric and mass flow rates, fan torque, rotational speed, and power consumption.</p>
                <p>By analyzing the data, we were able to calculate key performance indicators such as head rise, fan shaft work, and system efficiency. The results were then used to plot performance curves for each fan type across various flow rates and speeds. This thorough approach enabled us to compare the backward and radial impellers in terms of efficiency, power consumption, and overall performance under different operating conditions. The experiment provided valuable insights into the behavior of centrifugal fans and allowed us to make informed conclusions about the strengths and limitations of each impeller design.</p>
