                <h2>Background</h2>
                <h2> </h2>
                <p>For my Dad&apos;s birthday I wanted to get him a collecitve that he could used in his helicopter sumulator games. The ones that were available on the market started at almost $400 for a very simple one with one or two buttons and the very cheap ones started at $100 for just a handle you could pivot, so I decided to build him one myself that would give the most functionality for a very reasonable price.</p>
                <h2> </h2>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The design process began with setting a clear set of goals, the primary objective being the incorporation of multiple functional inputs. I sketched several concepts, each with distinct features, and selected the most practical elements from each to integrate into the final design. With these components in mind, I started building a rough model in SolidWorks. This initial model helped me better understand the overall scale and identify where key hardware elements would be placed. From there, I iterated on the design to ensure I used the most cost-effective parts available, such as a PVC pipe for the main stalk and a potentiometer for angle input.</p>
                <p>Given that the usual 3D printing resources were unavailable during the semester, I needed to pay per gram for printing from an outside source. This made optimizing the 3D-printed components critical, as I had to strike a balance between minimizing material usage and ensuring sufficient strength. Using SolidWorks, I performed FEA to verify that each part could withstand the expected stresses and impacts. Once I was confident in the design's durability, I printed the necessary parts and began assembly.</p>
                <p>For the input system, I selected three buttons, two toggle switches, and a three-way momentary toggle, all mounted on the head of the stalk. I carefully routed the wiring down the stalk to the base, where the Arduino controller would be housed. To ensure the stalk could remain in any position without succumbing to gravity, I incorporated a spring system that provided consistent resistance. Additionally, I implemented a 3:1 gear ratio between the potentiometer and the stalk, allowing for precise control with 0.16 inches of travel for each degree of stalk pivot.</p>
                <p>To mount the system securely to the office chair, I used 80/20 extruded aluminum to extend from the chair's base and employed a custom SendCutSend bracket to hold everything in place. After assembling the entire unit, I mounted it to the chair, installed a software plug-in that enabled Arduino inputs to communicate with the flight simulator, and connected the Arduino to the computer.</p>
                <p>The completed project functions exceptionally well, providing a much more immersive flight simulator experience by offering precise control and seamless integration.</p>
